# PytorchCapstone
The objective of this capstone project is to build and train a deep learning model for image classification. You will utilize a publicly available dataset, implement a deep neural network, and evaluate its performance. This project will allow you to apply the concepts and skills you have learned in deep learning to a real-world problem.
